<TODO>
Further optimize the video drawing routines.(mmx section)




</TODO>

Need to get the debugger finished
Need to enable a forced language

List of things for version c release:
RSP/RDP dummy enabled
RSP/AI dummy enabled
DLL support
Adaptoid support
Exceptions redone

MarioKart sample: splitting the screen into 4 different viewports and sending to different
   targets.

Dynarec:

block - (n) A variable size section of compiled code that is limited only by code that is
  executed. Stopped by JR,JALR, or until the size limit has been reached. CRC'd to verify
  block is valid at each execution. Currently only 255 blocks can exist at once.

element - (n) A single instruction compiled into code.

s_branch - (n) A variable during compile time to determine when it is time to stop. By
  default, 32 branches are allowed. This should be enough for

invalidate - (v) a known invalidation caused by DMA, TLB, or new ROM in which time is saved
  and memory freed by invalidating the range just copied.

compileBlock - (v) an action to create a block and insert it into the smallest available
  contiguous memory of the scratchpad.

dynarec Exception - (v) an act of jumping out of code, and entering the exception handler
  to handle any number of possibilities. One possibility is a exception, the intel pc is saved,
  and returned so a new block doesn't have to be compiled. This would need to CRC the block
  it resides in, so the block # would be necessary.

segment - (n) a section of elements that are not jumped into the middle of and can be optimized
  by out of order execution and weaving the instructions together. Any jump into the middle of
  a segment will cause an entirely new segment to be generated.
